    <h1>General Notes</h1>

    <h3>Important Terms</h3>
    <div>
        <p><b>html</b> = HyperText Markup Language, the primary
        coding language and main type of document of
        the Internet</p>
        <p><b>http</b> = Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the method
        by which a browser (at the direction of a computer)
        requests html files from a server</p>
        <p><b>elements</b> are the basic building blocks of html
        code; most are further customized with tags and attributes</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
    <div>
      <p><b>The Web</b> is a vast network of <b>tubes</b>. Actually, links.
        Pages linked to each other form the Internet. Basic
        pages formed from html documents and text contain more
        complex files such as images, audio and video.</p>
      <p><b>html</b> is a language for building webpages out of boxes, or blocks.
        The blocks are usually made of smaller blocks, and painted in different
        ways, and they may even have contents of their own, but the most basic
        piece of a page will always be a block. Pages are built out of painted
        blocks and then connected by links. When turning a page concept into
        html a designer will often break the concept down into the most basic
        blocks, or "boxify" it, to visualize the underlying structure and then
        attack it in pieces.</p>
      <p>Computers are <b>dumb</b>. While normal conversation allows for a
        fair degree of ambiguity, relying on the listener to use context
        clues and their own knowledge to understand your meaning,
        <span style="color:#ff0000">a computer will interpret your language
        as literally as possible.</span> This is the source of many issues
        between programmers and computers.</p>
      <p>Me[Computer]Browser ---> (((THE INTERNET))) --HTTP-> Server</p>
      <p>In html, <b>whitespace</b> such as extra spaces and new lines will be
        condensed when the code is actually rendered. This is the reason
        line breaks are used.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Tag Basics</h3>
    <div>
      <p><b>First rule of tag club:</b> An unclosed tag will mark up everything after the opening tag.</p>
      <p><b>Second rule of tag club:</b> IT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE
        ATTRIBUTES OF EVERY TAG. There are too many tags and attributes
        for remembering all of them to be practical. When developing in
        html, it's appropriate to use online resources such as <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">
        W3Schools</a> or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
        Mozilla Developer Network.</a></p>
      <p><b>b</b> is a tag for <b>bolding</b> text; <b>em</b> is a tag to
        <em>emphasize</em> text with italics.</p>
      <p><b>a</b> is an anchor tag, for making <a href="https://www.udacity.com">links</a>.</p>
      <p><b>href</b> is an attribute of the anchor tag; the value
        should be the URL of the link.</p>
      <p><b>img</b> is the <img
        src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRK8dRnT20J_N9reoSkNzqt7h-IBNmX9nsohI9TH-LuFPzDIUqIkA"
        alt="This is just some classic tomfoolery.">
        tag; <b>src</b> is an attribute for the source of the image;
        <b>alt</b> is an attribute for alt text, which will load if
        the image does not.</p>
      <p>(img is a <b>void tag</b>, or a tag that has no content and
        therefore needs no closing tag)</p>
      <b>br</b> is a break tag, to break up
        lines of text.<br>
      <p>Text can also be broken up with <b>p</b>, the
        paragraph tag; p <b>wraps</b>, so it needs
        content and a closing tag.</p>
      <p>While br is simply ending a line,
        p is creating a whole new element
        which can have its own attributes like
        height (a <b>block tag</b>).</p>
      <p><b>span</b> and <b>div</b> create container elements,
        with div creating a box and span creating an inline element.These tags
        are useful for assigning a css <b>class</b> to text, making it easier to
        add character to your page.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>HTML Documents</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Doctypes in html used to be hellish; html5
        has simplified it a great deal. Now the doctype
        html is sufficient for any html document.</p>
      <p>In an actual html document, the header will contain
        things like metadata, css and the title of the page.</p>
      <p>The actual content of the document will be in the
        body section, sometimes broken up under different headings.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Code Structure</h1>
    <div>
      <p>A new indent signals the beginning of a new
        idea, but a new idea will <em>increase</em>
        the indentation level, decreasing it when the
        idea is complete.</p>
      <p>The doctype declares what language the browser
        should parse the document in, in this case html.</p>
      <p>The html tag opens the actual code of the document,
        under which there will be a header, a body and
        a closing html tag.</p>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
